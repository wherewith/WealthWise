                      Use Sustainable Transportation
                  </h3>
                  <p class="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">Today, gas prices are exceptionally high. If possible and available, you should use public transportation to save money.
                       For example, Texas A&M University, will provide free bus service both on/off campus as long as you are a valid student.
                      Another option is to consider investing in a bicycle. In the long run, it will be more cost-efficient than the gasoline required to fill up your tank. On top of the financial benefit, sustainable transporation is better for the environment!</p>

                      Limit Food Delivery Services
                  </h3>
                  <p class="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">Although food-delivery services are very convenient, limiting the number of times you order delivery can easily help you save money.
                      Every time you order food delivery, you are paying for increased menu prices, convenience fees, gasoline fees, and a delivery tip.
                      Now, if you were to have those expenses occur multiple times a week, you would see that it adds up! By limiting food-delivery, you can save a lot of money.</p>

                      Use Student Discounts
                  </h3>
                  <p class="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">A lot of services and restaurants have student discounts available, as long as you show valid proof of ID.
                      For example, Spotify Premium + Hulu bundle costs $4.99/month. If you were to buy Spotify Premium and Hulu separately, you would end up spending $17.98/month! Just from that alone, you save $12.99/month.
                      Restaurants, Movie theaters, and other services also have similar student pricing, which will help you save.</p>

                      Create a Monthly Budget
                  </h3>
                  <p class="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">Make a plan on how you will spend your money each month. Having a budget plan can help you keep track of your monthly income and expenses. Try out our LINK (budget tool).</p>
